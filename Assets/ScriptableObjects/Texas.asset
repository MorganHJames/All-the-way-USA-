  info: "Texas is the second largest state in the United States by area (after Alaska)
    and population (after California). Located in the South Central region, Texas
    shares borders with the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast,
    Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua,
    Coahuila, Nuevo Le\xF3n, and Tamaulipas to the southwest, and has a coastline
    with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast.  Houston is the most populous city in
    Texas and the fourth largest in the U.S., while San Antonio is the second-most
    populous in the state and seventh largest in the U.S. Dallas\u2013Fort Worth and
    Greater Houston are the fourth and fifth largest metropolitan statistical areas
    in the country, respectively. Other major cities include Austin, the second-most
    populous state capital in the U.S., and El Paso. Texas is nicknamed the \"Lone
    Star State\" for its former status as an independent republic, and as a reminder
    of the state's struggle for independence from Mexico. The \"Lone Star\" can be
    found on the Texas state flag and on the Texas state seal. The origin of Texas's
    name is from the word taysha, which means \"friends\" in the Caddo language.  Due
    to its size and geologic features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse
    landscapes common to both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions. Although
    Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts, less than 10%
    of Texas's land area is desert. Most of the population centers are in areas of
    former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to
    west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods,
    to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the desert and mountains of the
    Big Bend.  The term \"six flags over Texas\" refers to several nations that have
    ruled over the territory. Spain was the first European country to claim and control
    the area of Texas. France held a short-lived colony. Mexico controlled the territory
    until 1836 when Texas won its independence, becoming an independent Republic.
    In 1845, Texas joined the union as the 28th state. The state's annexation set
    off a chain of events that led to the Mexican\u2013American War in 1846. A slave
    state before the American Civil War, Texas declared its secession from the U.S.
    in early 1861, and officially joined the Confederate States of America on March
    2 of the same year. After the Civil War and the restoration of its representation
    in the federal government, Texas entered a long period of economic stagnation.
    \ Historically four major industries shaped the Texas economy prior to World War
    II: cattle and bison, cotton, timber, and oil. Before and after the U.S. Civil
    War the cattle industry, which Texas came to dominate, was a major economic driver
    for the state, thus creating the traditional image of the Texas cowboy. In the
    later 19th century cotton and lumber grew to be major industries as the cattle
    industry became less lucrative. It was ultimately, though, the discovery of major
    petroleum deposits (Spindletop in particular) that initiated an economic boom
    which became the driving force behind the economy for much of the 20th century.
    With strong investments in universities, Texas developed a diversified economy
    and high tech industry in the mid-20th century. As of 2015, it is second on the
    list of the most Fortune 500 companies with 54. With a growing base of industry,
    the state leads in many industries, including tourism, agriculture, petrochemicals,
    energy, computers and electronics, aerospace, and biomedical sciences. Texas has
    led the U.S. in state export revenue since 2002 and has the second-highest gross
    state product. If Texas were a sovereign state, it would be the 10th largest economy
    in the world."
