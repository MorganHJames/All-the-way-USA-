  info: "Hawai\u02BBi is a state of the United States of America. It is the only state
    located in the Pacific Ocean and the only state composed entirely of islands.
    \ The state encompasses nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago, 137 islands spread
    over 1,500 miles (2,400 km). The volcanic archipelago is physiographically and
    ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania. At the southeastern
    end of the archipelago, the eight main islands are, in order from northwest to
    southeast: Ni\u02BBihau, Kaua\u02BBi, O\u02BBahu, Moloka\u02BBi, L\u0101na\u02BBi,
    Kaho\u02BBolawe, Maui, and Hawai\u02BBi. The last is the largest island in the
    group; it is often called the \"Big Island\" or \"Hawai\u02BBi Island\" to avoid
    confusion with the state or archipelago.  Hawai\u02BBi is the 8th-smallest geographically
    and the 11th-least populous, but the 13th-most densely populated of the 50 states.
    It is the only state with an Asian American plurality. Hawaii has more than 1.4
    million permanent residents, along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel.
    The state capital and largest city is Honolulu on the island of O\u02BBahu. The
    state's ocean coastline is about 750 miles (1,210 km) long, the fourth longest
    in the U.S., after the coastlines of Alaska, Florida, and California. Hawaii is
    the most recent state to join the union, on August 21, 1959. It was an independent
    nation until 1898.  Hawai\u02BBi's diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate,
    abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, and active volcanoes make it
    a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists. Because
    of its central location in the Pacific and 19th-century labor migration, Hawaii's
    culture is strongly influenced by North American and East Asian cultures, in addition
    to its indigenous Hawaiian culture."
