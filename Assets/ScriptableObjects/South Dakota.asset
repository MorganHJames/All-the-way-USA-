  info: South Dakota is a U.S. state in the Midwestern region of the United States.
    It is named after the Lakota and Dakota Sioux Native American tribes, who compose
    a large portion of the population and historically dominated the territory. South
    Dakota is the seventeenth largest by area, but the fifth smallest by population
    and the 5th least densely populated of the 50 United States. As the southern part
    of the former Dakota Territory, South Dakota became a state on November 2, 1889,
    simultaneously with North Dakota. Pierre is the state capital and Sioux Falls,
    with a population of about 187,200, is South Dakota's largest city.  South Dakota
    is bordered by the states of North Dakota (to the north), Minnesota (to the east),
    Iowa (to the southeast), Nebraska (to the south), Wyoming (to the west), and Montana
    (to the northwest). The state is bisected by the Missouri River, dividing South
    Dakota into two geographically and socially distinct halves, known to residents
    as "East River" and "West River".  Eastern South Dakota is home to most of the
    state's population, and the area's fertile soil is used to grow a variety of crops.
    West of the Missouri River, ranching is the predominant agricultural activity,
    and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the
    Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low
    pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state.
    Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate
    continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from
    moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species
    typical of a North American grassland biome.  Humans have inhabited the area for
    several millennia, with the Sioux becoming dominant by the early 19th century.
    In the late 19th century, European-American settlement intensified after a gold
    rush in the Black Hills and the construction of railroads from the east. Encroaching
    miners and settlers triggered a number of Indian wars, ending with the Wounded
    Knee Massacre in 1890. Key events in the 20th century included the Dust Bowl and
    Great Depression, increased federal spending during the 1940s and 1950s for agriculture
    and defense, and an industrialization of agriculture that has reduced family farming.  While
    several Democrats have represented South Dakota for multiple terms in both chambers
    of Congress, the state government is largely controlled by the Republican Party,
    whose nominees have carried South Dakota in each of the last 13 presidential elections.
    Historically dominated by an agricultural economy and a rural lifestyle, South
    Dakota has recently sought to diversify its economy in areas to attract and retain
    residents. South Dakota's history and rural character still strongly influence
    the state's culture.
