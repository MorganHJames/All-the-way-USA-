    center. The city derives its name from a rock formation along the river, named
    the \"Little Rock\" (French: La Petite Roche) by the French explorer Jean-Baptiste
    B\xE9nard de la Harpe in the 1720s. The capital of the Arkansas Territory was
    moved to Little Rock from Arkansas Post in 1821. The city's population was 197,881
