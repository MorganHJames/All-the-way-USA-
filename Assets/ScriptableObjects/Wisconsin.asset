  info: Wisconsin is a U.S. state located in the north-central, Midwest and Great
    Lakes regions of the country. It is bordered by Minnesota to the west, Iowa to
    the southwest, Illinois to the south, Lake Michigan to the east, Michigan to the
    northeast, and Lake Superior to the north. Wisconsin is the 23rd largest state
    by total area and the 20th most populous. The state capital is Madison, and its
    largest city is Milwaukee, which is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan.
    The state is divided into 72 counties.  Wisconsin's geography is diverse, having
    been greatly impacted by glaciers during the Ice Age with the exception of the
    Driftless Area. The Northern Highland and Western Upland along with a part of
    the Central Plain occupies the western part of the state, with lowlands stretching
    to the shore of Lake Michigan. Wisconsin is second to Michigan in the length of
    its Great Lakes coastline.  During the 19th and early 20th centuries, many European
    settlers entered the state, many of whom emigrated from Germany and Scandinavia.
    Like neighboring Minnesota, the state remains a center of German American and
    Scandinavian American culture.  The state is one of the nation's leading dairy
    producers and is known as "America's Dairyland"; it is particularly famous for
    its cheese. Manufacturing (especially paper products), information technology
    (IT), cranberries, ginseng, and tourism are also major contributors to the state's
    economy.
