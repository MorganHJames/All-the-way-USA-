  info: "Colorado is a state of the Western United States encompassing most of the
    southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau
    and the western edge of the Great Plains. It is the 8th most extensive and 21st
    most populous U.S. state. The estimated population of Colorado is 5,770,545 as
    of 2019, an increase of 14.7% since the 2010 United States Census.  The state
    was named for the Colorado River, which early Spanish explorers named the R\xEDo
    Colorado (\"Red River\") for the ruddy silt the river carried from the mountains.
    The Territory of Colorado was organized on February 28, 1861, and on August 1,
    1876, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant signed Proclamation 230 admitting Colorado
    to the Union as the 38th state. Colorado is nicknamed the \"Centennial State\"
    because it became a state one century after the signing of the United States Declaration
    of Independence.  Colorado is bordered by Wyoming to the north, Nebraska to the
    northeast, Kansas to the east, Oklahoma to the southeast, New Mexico to the south,
    Utah to the west, and touches Arizona to the southwest at the Four Corners. Colorado
    is noted for its vivid landscape of mountains, forests, high plains, mesas, canyons,
    plateaus, rivers and desert lands. Colorado is part of the western and southwestern
    United States and is one of the Mountain States.  Denver is the capital and most
    populous city of Colorado. Residents of the state are known as Coloradans, although
    the antiquated term \"Coloradoan\" is occasionally used."
