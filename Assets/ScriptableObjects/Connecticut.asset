  info: Connecticut is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern
    United States. As of the 2010 Census, it has the highest per-capita income, Human
    Development Index (0.962), and median household income in the United States. It
    is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York
    to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital is Hartford and its
    most populous city is Bridgeport. It is part of New England, although portions
    of it are often grouped with New York and New Jersey as the tri-state area. The
    state is named for the Connecticut River which approximately bisects the state.
    The word "Connecticut" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian
    word for "long tidal river".  Connecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen
    who established a small, short-lived settlement called Fort Hoop in Hartford at
    the confluence of the Park and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially
    part of the Dutch colony New Netherland, which included much of the land between
    the Connecticut and Delaware Rivers, although the first major settlements were
    established in the 1630s by the English. Thomas Hooker led a band of followers
    from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and founded the Connecticut Colony; other settlers
    from Massachusetts founded the Saybrook Colony and the New Haven Colony. The Connecticut
    and New Haven colonies established documents of Fundamental Orders, considered
    the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under
    a royal charter, making Connecticut a crown colony. This was one of the Thirteen
    Colonies which rejected British rule in the American Revolution.  Connecticut
    is the third smallest state by area, the 29th most populous, and the fourth most
    densely populated of the 50 states. It is known as the "Constitution State", the
    "Nutmeg State", the "Provisions State", and the "Land of Steady Habits". It was
    influential in the development of the federal government of the United States
    (see Connecticut Compromise).  The Connecticut River, Thames River, and ports
    along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which
    continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services
    industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in Fairfield
    County.
