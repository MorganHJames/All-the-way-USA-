  info: "Minnesota is a state in the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, and northern regions
    of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11,
    1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has
    many lakes, and is known as the \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\". Its official motto is
    L'\xC9toile du Nord (French: Star of the North).  Minnesota is the 12th largest
    in area and the 22nd most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 55% of its residents
    live in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \"Twin
    Cities\"). This area has the largest concentration of transportation, business,
    industry, education, and government in the state. Urban centers in \"Greater Minnesota\"
    include Duluth, Mankato, Moorhead, Rochester and St. Cloud.  The geography of
    the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture;
    deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed, and settled;
    and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation.
    \ Thousands of years before Europeans arrived, Minnesota was inhabited by various
    indigenous peoples, some of whom remain in the state today. French explorers,
    missionaries, and fur traders began exploring the region in the 17th century,
    encountering the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe tribes. Much of what is now Minnesota
    was part of the vast French holding of Louisiana, which was purchased by the United
    States in 1803. Following several territorial reorganizations, Minnesota in its
    current form was admitted as the country's 32nd state on May 11, 1858. Like many
    Midwestern states, it remained sparsely populated and centered on lumber and agriculture.
    During the 19th and early 20th centuries, many European immigrants, mainly from
    Scandinavia and Germany, began to settle the state, which remains a center of
    Scandinavian American and German American culture.  Immigration from Asia, the
    Horn of Africa, the Middle East, and (to a lesser extent) Latin America has broadened
    Minnesota's demographics and culture. Its economy has greatly diversified, shifting
    from traditional activities such as agriculture and resource extraction to services
    and finance. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the
    United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in
    the nation."
