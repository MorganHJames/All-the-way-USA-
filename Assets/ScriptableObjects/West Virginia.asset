  info: West Virginia is a state located in the Appalachian region of the Southern
    United States, and is also considered to be a part of the Mid-Atlantic Southeast
    Region. It is bordered by Pennsylvania to the north, Maryland to the east and
    northeast, Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, and Ohio to the
    northwest. West Virginia is the 41st largest state by area, and is ranked 38th
    in population. The capital and largest city is Charleston.  West Virginia became
    a state following the Wheeling Conventions of 1861, at the start of the American
    Civil War. Delegates from the Unionist counties of northwestern Virginia decided
    to break away from Virginia, which also included secessionist counties in the
    new state. West Virginia was admitted to the Union on June 20, 1863, and was a
    key border state during the war. It was the only state to form by separating from
    a Confederate state, the first to separate from any state since Maine separated
    from Massachusetts, and was one of two states admitted to the Union during the
    American Civil War (the other being Nevada). While a portion of its residents
    held slaves, most of the residents were yeoman farmers, and the delegates provided
    for gradual abolition of slavery in the new state Constitution.  The Census Bureau
    and the Association of American Geographers classify West Virginia as part of
    the Southern United States. However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies
    the state as a part of the Mid-Atlantic region. The northern panhandle extends
    adjacent to Pennsylvania and Ohio, with the West Virginia cities of Wheeling and
    Weirton just across the border from the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, while Bluefield
    is less than 70 miles (110 km) from North Carolina. Huntington in the southwest
    is close to the states of Ohio and Kentucky, while Martinsburg and Harpers Ferry
    in the Eastern Panhandle region are considered part of the Washington metropolitan
    area, in between the states of Maryland and Virginia. The unique position of West
    Virginia means that it is often included in several U.S. geographical regions,
    including the Mid-Atlantic, the Upland South, and the Southeastern United States.
    It is the only state that is entirely within the area served by the Appalachian
    Regional Commission; the area is commonly defined as "Appalachia".  The state
    is noted for its mountains and rolling hills, its historically significant logging
    and coal mining industries, and its political and labor history. It is also known
    for a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities, including skiing, whitewater
    rafting, fishing, hiking, backpacking, mountain biking, rock climbing, and hunting.
