  info: "Arizona is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is
    also part of the Western and the Mountain states. It is the 6th largest and the
    14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix.
    Arizona shares the Four Corners region with Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico; its
    other neighboring states are Nevada and California to the west and the Mexican
    states of Sonora and Baja California to the south and southwest.  Arizona is the
    48th state and last of the contiguous states to be admitted to the Union, achieving
    statehood on February 14, 1912, coinciding with Valentine's Day. Historically
    part of the territory of Alta California in New Spain, it became part of independent
    Mexico in 1821. After being defeated in the Mexican\u2013American War, Mexico
    ceded much of this territory to the United States in 1848. The southernmost portion
    of the state was acquired in 1853 through the Gadsden Purchase.  Southern Arizona
    is known for its desert climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. Northern
    Arizona features forests of pine, Douglas fir, and spruce trees; the Colorado
    Plateau; mountain ranges (such as the San Francisco Mountains); as well as large,
    deep canyons, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter
    snowfalls. There are ski resorts in the areas of Flagstaff, Alpine, and Tucson.
    In addition to the internationally known Grand Canyon National Park, which is
    one of the world's seven natural wonders, there are several national forests,
    national parks, and national monuments.  About one-quarter of the state is made
    up of Indian reservations that serve as the home of 27 federally recognized Native
    American tribes, including the Navajo Nation, the largest in the state and the
    United States, with more than 300,000 citizens. Although federal law gave all
    Native Americans the right to vote in 1924, Arizona excluded those living on reservations
    in the state from voting until the state Supreme Court ruled in favor of Native
    American plaintiffs in Trujillo v. Garley (1948)."
