  info: New Jersey is a state in the Mid-Atlantic region of the Northeastern United
    States. It is a peninsula, bordered on the north and east by the state of New
    York; on the east, southeast, and south by the Atlantic Ocean; on the west by
    the Delaware River and Pennsylvania; and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay
    and Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most
    populous, with 9 million residents as of 2017, making it the most densely populated
    of the 50 U.S. states with its biggest city being Newark. New Jersey lies completely
    within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia. New Jersey
    was the second-wealthiest U.S. state by median household income as of 2017.  New
    Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years, with historical
    tribes such as the Lenape along the coast. In the early 17th century, the Dutch
    and the Swedes founded the first European settlements in the state. The English
    later seized control of the region, naming it the Province of New Jersey after
    the largest of the Channel Islands, Jersey, and granting it as a colony to Sir
    George Carteret and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton. New Jersey
    was the site of several important battles during the American Revolutionary War
    in the 18th century.  In the 19th century, factories in the cities Camden, Paterson,
    Newark, Trenton, Jersey City, and Elizabeth (known as the "Big Six"), helped drive
    the Industrial Revolution. New Jersey's geographic location at the center of the
    Northeast megalopolis, between Boston and New York City to the northeast, and
    Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., to the southwest, fueled its rapid
    growth through the process of suburbanization in the second half of the 20th century.
    At the turn of the 21st century, this suburbanization began reverting with the
    consolidation of New Jersey's culturally diverse populace toward more urban settings
    within the state, with towns home to commuter rail stations outpacing the population
    growth of more automobile-oriented suburbs since 2008.  As of 2018, New Jersey
    was home to the highest number of millionaires per capita of all U.S. states.
    New Jersey's public school system consistently ranks at or among the top of all
    fifty U.S. states.
