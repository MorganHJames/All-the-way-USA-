  info: North Carolina is a U.S. state located in the southeastern region of the United
    States. North Carolina is the 28th largest and 9th-most populous of the 50 United
    States. It is bordered by Virginia to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the east,
    Georgia and South Carolina to the south, and Tennessee to the west. Raleigh is
    the state's capital and Charlotte is its largest city. The Charlotte metropolitan
    area, with an estimated population of 2,569,213 in 2018, is the most populous
    metropolitan area in North Carolina, the 23rd-most populous in the United States,
    and the largest banking center in the nation after New York City. The Raleigh
    metropolitan area is the second-largest metropolitan area in the state, with an
    estimated population of 1,362,540 in 2018, and is home to the largest research
    park in the United States, Research Triangle Park.  North Carolina was established
    as a royal colony in 1729 and is one of the original Thirteen Colonies. North
    Carolina is named in honor of King Charles I of England who first formed the English
    colony, with Carolus being Latin for "Charles". On November 21, 1789, North Carolina
    became the 12th state to ratify the United States Constitution. North Carolina
    declared its secession from the Union (American Civil War) on May 20, 1861, becoming
    the last of eleven states to join the Confederate States. Following the Civil
    War, the state was restored to the Union on June 25, 1868. On December 17, 1903,
    Orville and Wilbur Wright successfully piloted the world's first controlled, sustained
    flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft at Kill Devil Hills in North Carolina's
    Outer Banks. North Carolina formerly used the slogan "First in Flight" on state
    license plates to commemorate this achievement. New plates use the slogan "First
    in Freedom" in reference to the Mecklenburg Declaration.  North Carolina is defined
    by a wide range of elevations and landscapes. From west to east, North Carolina's
    elevation descends from the Appalachian Mountains to the Piedmont and Atlantic
    coastal plain. North Carolina's Mount Mitchell at 6,684 feet (2,037 m) is the
    highest-point in North America east of the Mississippi River. Most of the state
    falls in the humid subtropical climate zone; however, the western, mountainous
    part of the state has a subtropical highland climate.
