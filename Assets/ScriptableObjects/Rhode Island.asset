  info: Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations,
    is a state in the New England region of the United States. It is the smallest
    U.S. state by area and the seventh least populous, but it is also the second most
    densely populated. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts
    to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound
    and Block Island Sound. It also shares a small maritime border with New York.
    Providence is the state capital and most populous city in Rhode Island.  On May
    4, 1776, the Colony of Rhode Island was the first of the Thirteen Colonies to
    renounce its allegiance to the British Crown, and it was the fourth among the
    newly independent states to ratify the Articles of Confederation on February 9,
    1778. The state boycotted the 1787 convention which drew up the United States
    Constitution and initially refused to ratify it; it was the last of the original
    13 states to do so on May 29, 1790.  Rhode Island's official nickname is "The
    Ocean State", a reference to the large bays and inlets that amount to about 14
    percent of its total area.
