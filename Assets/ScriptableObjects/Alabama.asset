  info: Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is
    bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf
    of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th largest
    by area and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. With a total of 1,500 miles
    (2,400 km) of inland waterways, Alabama has among the most of any state.  Alabama
    is nicknamed the Yellowhammer State, after the state bird. Alabama is also known
    as the "Heart of Dixie" and the "Cotton State". The state tree is the longleaf
    pine, and the state flower is the camellia. Alabama's capital is Montgomery. The
    largest city by population is Birmingham, which has long been the most industrialized
    city; the largest city by land area is Huntsville. The oldest city is Mobile,
    founded by French colonists in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana. The Greater
    Birmingham metropolitan area is Alabama's most populous urban area.  From the
    American Civil War until World War II, Alabama, like many states in the southern
    U.S., suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence
    on agriculture. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed
    Jim Crow laws to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against African Americans
    from the end of the Reconstruction Era up until at least the 1970s. Despite the
    growth of major industries and urban centers, white rural interests dominated
    the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests
    and African Americans were markedly under-represented. Following World War II,
    Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture
    to one with diversified interests. The state's economy in the 21st century is
    based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction,
    healthcare, education, retail, and technology. The Greater Birmingham metropolitan
    area is by far the state's largest urban economy and its economic center.
