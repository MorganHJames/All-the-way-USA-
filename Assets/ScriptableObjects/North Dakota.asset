  info: North Dakota is a U.S. state in the midwestern and northern regions of the
    United States. It is the nineteenth largest in area, the fourth smallest by population,
    and the fourth most sparsely populated of the 50 states. North Dakota was admitted
    to the Union on November 2, 1889, along with its neighboring state, South Dakota.
    Its capital is Bismarck, and its largest city is Fargo.  In the 21st century,
    North Dakota's natural resources have played a major role in its economic performance,
    particularly with the oil extraction from the Bakken formation, which lies beneath
    the northwestern part of the state. Such development has led to population growth
    and reduced unemployment, resulting in North Dakota having the second lowest unemployment
    rate in the nation, behind only Hawaii.  North Dakota contains the tallest man-made
    structure in the Western Hemisphere, the KVLY-TV mast.
