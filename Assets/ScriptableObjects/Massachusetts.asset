  info: Massachusetts, officially known as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the
    most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States.
    It borders on the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode
    Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the
    west. The capital of Massachusetts is Boston, which is also the most populous
    city in New England. It is home to the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region
    influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent
    on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing
    center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts's
    economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global
    leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime
    trade.  Plymouth was the site of the second colony in New England after Popham
    Colony in 1607 in what is now Maine. Plymouth was founded in 1620 by the Pilgrims,
    passengers of the Mayflower. In 1692, the town of Salem and surrounding areas
    experienced one of America's most infamous cases of mass hysteria, the Salem witch
    trials. In 1777, General Henry Knox founded the Springfield Armory, which during
    the Industrial Revolution catalyzed numerous important technological advances,
    including interchangeable parts. In 1786, Shays' Rebellion, a populist revolt
    led by disaffected American Revolutionary War veterans, influenced the United
    States Constitutional Convention. In the 18th century, the Protestant First Great
    Awakening, which swept the Atlantic World, originated from the pulpit of Northampton
    preacher Jonathan Edwards. In the late 18th century, Boston became known as the
    "Cradle of Liberty" for the agitation there that led to the American Revolution.  The
    entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts has played a powerful scientific, commercial,
    and cultural role in the history of the United States. Before the American Civil
    War, Massachusetts was a center for the abolitionist, temperance, and transcendentalist
    movements. In the late 19th century, the sports of basketball and volleyball were
    invented in the western Massachusetts cities of Springfield and Holyoke, respectively.
    In 2004, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state to legally recognize same-sex
    marriage as a result of the decision in Goodridge v. Department of Public Health
    by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Many prominent American political
    dynasties have hailed from the state, including the Adams and Kennedy families.
    Harvard University in Cambridge is the oldest institution of higher learning in
    the United States, with the largest financial endowment of any university, and
    Harvard Law School has educated a contemporaneous majority of Justices of the
    Supreme Court of the United States. Kendall Square in Cambridge has been called
    "the most innovative square mile on the planet", in reference to the high concentration
    of entrepreneurial start-ups and quality of innovation which have emerged in the
    vicinity of the square since 2010. Both Harvard University and the Massachusetts
    Institute of Technology, also in Cambridge, have been ranked among the most highly
    regarded academic institutions in the world. Massachusetts' public-school students
    place among the top tier in the world in academic performance; and according to
    the World Population Review's 2020 ranking, Massachusetts' residents demonstrated
    the highest average intelligence quotient of all U.S. states. The state has been
    ranked as one of the top states in the United States for citizens to live in,
    as well as one of the most expensive.
