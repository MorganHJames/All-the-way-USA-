  info: 'Iowa is a state in the Midwestern United States, bordered by the Mississippi
    River to the east and the Missouri River and Big Sioux River to the west. It is
    bordered by six states: Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to the east and southeast,
    Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the northwest, and
    Minnesota to the north.  In colonial times, Iowa was a part of French Louisiana
    and Spanish Louisiana; its state flag is patterned after the flag of France. After
    the Louisiana Purchase, people laid the foundation for an agriculture-based economy
    in the heart of the Corn Belt.  In the latter half of the 20th century, Iowa''s
    agricultural economy made the transition to a diversified economy of advanced
    manufacturing, processing, financial services, information technology, biotechnology,
    and green energy production. Iowa is the 26th most extensive in land area and
    the 30th most populous of the 50 U.S. states. The state''s capital, most populous
    city, and largest metropolitan area fully located within the state is Des Moines.
    A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three
    counties of southwest Iowa. Iowa has been listed as one of the safest states to
    live in.'
