  info: "Vermont is a northeastern U.S. state in the New England region. It borders
    the states of Massachusetts to the south, New Hampshire to the east, and New York
    to the west, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north. Vermont is the
    second-smallest by population and the sixth-smallest by area of the 50 U.S. states.
    The state capital is Montpelier, the least populous state capital in the United
    States. The most populous city, Burlington, is the least populous city to be the
    most populous city in a state. Vermont's crime statistics for the period 2016-8
    caused it to be ranked as the safest state in the country.  For some 12,000 years,
    indigenous peoples inhabited this area. The historically competitive tribes of
    the Algonquian-speaking Abenaki and Iroquoian-speaking Mohawk were active in the
    area at the time of European encounter.  During the 17th century, French colonists
    claimed the territory as part of the Kingdom of France's colony of New France.
    After the Kingdom of Great Britain began to settle colonies to the south along
    the Atlantic coast, the two nations competed in North America in addition to Europe.
    For years, each country enlisted Native American allies in continuous raiding
    and warfare between the New England and New France colonies. This produced an
    active trade in captives taken during such raids, often held for ransom, although
    some captives were adopted by families into the Mohawk or Abenaki tribes.  After
    being defeated in 1763 in the Seven Years' War, France ceded its territory east
    of the Mississippi River to Great Britain. Thereafter, the nearby British Thirteen
    Colonies, especially the provinces of New Hampshire and New York, disputed the
    extent of the area called the New Hampshire Grants to the west of the Connecticut
    River, encompassing present-day Vermont. The provincial government of New York
    sold land grants to settlers in the region, which conflicted with earlier grants
    from the government of New Hampshire. The Green Mountain Boys militia protected
    the interests of the established New Hampshire land grant settlers against the
    newly-arrived settlers with land titles granted by New York.  Ultimately, a group
    of settlers with New Hampshire land grant titles established the Vermont Republic
    in 1777 as an independent state during the American Revolutionary War. The Vermont
    Republic abolished slavery before any of the other states. Vermont was also the
    first state to produce an African-American university graduate, Alexander Twilight,
    in 1823.  Vermont was admitted to the newly established United States as the fourteenth
    state in 1791. Vermont is one of the four U.S. states that were previously sovereign
    states (along with Texas, California, and Hawaii).  During the mid-19th century,
    Vermont was a strong source of abolitionist sentiment, although it was also tied
    to King Cotton through the development of textile mills in the region, which relied
    on southern cotton. It sent a significant contingent of soldiers to participate
    in the American Civil War. In the 21st century, Protestants (30%) and Catholics
    (22%) make up the majority of those reporting a religious preference, with 37%
    reporting no religion, the highest rate of irreligion of all states. Other religions
    individually contribute no more than 2% to the total.  The geography of the state
    is marked by the Green Mountains, which run north\u2013south up the middle of
    the state, separating Lake Champlain and other valley terrain on the west from
    the Connecticut River valley that defines much of its eastern border. A majority
    of its terrain is forested with hardwoods and conifers, and a majority of its
    open land is devoted to agriculture. The state's climate is characterized by warm,
    humid summers and cold, snowy winters.  Vermont's economic activity of $34 billion
    in 2018 ranked 52nd on the list of U.S. states and territories by GDP (every state
    plus Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico were larger), but 34th in GDP per capita.
    In 1960, Vermonters' politics started to shift from being reliably Republican
    toward favoring Democratic candidates. Starting in 1963, Vermont voters have alternated
    between electing Republican and Democratic governors. Since 2007, Vermont has
    elected only Democrats and Independents to Congress. In 2000, the state legislature
    was the first to recognize civil unions for same-sex couples. In 2011\u20132012,
    the state officially recognized four Abenaki tribes."
