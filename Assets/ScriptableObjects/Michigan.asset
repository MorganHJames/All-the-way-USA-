  info: "Michigan is a state in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions of the United
    States. Its name originates from the Ojibwe word mishigamaa, meaning \"large water\"
    or \"large lake\". With a population of just under 10 million, Michigan is the
    tenth most populous of the 50 United States, with the 11th most extensive total
    area, and is the largest state by total area east of the Mississippi River. Its
    capital is Lansing, and its largest city is Detroit. Metro Detroit is among the
    nation's most populous and largest metropolitan economies.  Michigan is the only
    state to consist of two peninsulas. The Lower Peninsula is often noted as being
    shaped like a mitten. The Upper Peninsula (often called \"the U.P.\") is separated
    from the Lower Peninsula by the Straits of Mackinac, a five-mile (8 km) channel
    that joins Lake Huron to Lake Michigan. The Mackinac Bridge connects the peninsulas.
    The state has the longest freshwater coastline of any political subdivision in
    the world, being bounded by four of the five Great Lakes, plus Lake Saint Clair.
    Michigan also has 64,980 inland lakes and ponds.  The area was first occupied
    by a succession of Native American tribes over thousands of years. Inhabited by
    Natives, M\xE9tis, and French explorers in the 17th century, it was claimed as
    part of New France colony. After France's defeat in the French and Indian War
    in 1762, the region came under British rule. Britain ceded this territory to the
    newly independent United States after Britain's defeat in the American Revolutionary
    War. The area was part of the larger Northwest Territory until 1800, when western
    Michigan became part of the Indiana Territory. Michigan Territory was formed in
    1805, but some of the northern border with Canada was not agreed upon until after
    the War of 1812. Michigan was admitted into the Union in 1837 as the 26th state,
    a free one. It soon became an important center of industry and trade in the Great
    Lakes region and a popular immigrant destination in the late 19th and early 20th
    centuries.  Although Michigan developed a diverse economy, it is widely known
    as the center of the U.S. automotive industry, which developed as a major economic
    force in the early 20th century. It is home to the country's three major automobile
    companies (whose headquarters are all within the Detroit metropolitan area). While
    sparsely populated, the Upper Peninsula is important for tourism thanks to its
    abundance of natural resources, while the Lower Peninsula is a center of manufacturing,
    forestry, agriculture, services, and high-tech industry."
