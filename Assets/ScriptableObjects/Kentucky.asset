  info: Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the
    Southern United States. Although styled as the "State of Kentucky" in the law
    creating it, (because in Kentucky's first constitution, the term "state" was used),
    Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others
    being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia,
    in 1792 Kentucky split from it and became the 15th state to join the Union. Kentucky
    is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States.  Kentucky
    is known as the "Bluegrass State", a nickname based on the bluegrass, a species
    of grass found in many of its pastures. One of the major regions in Kentucky is
    the Bluegrass Region in central Kentucky, which houses its two largest cities,
    Louisville and Lexington. It is a land with diverse environments and abundant
    resources, including the world's longest cave system, Mammoth Cave National Park,
    one of the greatest lengths of navigable waterways and streams in the contiguous
    United States, and the two largest man-made lakes east of the Mississippi River.  Kentucky
    is also known for horse racing, bourbon, moonshine, coal, "My Old Kentucky Home"
    historic state park, automobile manufacturing, tobacco, bluegrass music, college
    basketball, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and the Kentucky colonel.
