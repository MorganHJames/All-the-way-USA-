  info: Delaware is one of the 50 states of the United States, in the Mid Atlantic
    region. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, north by Pennsylvania,
    and east by New Jersey and the Atlantic Ocean. The state takes its name from Thomas
    West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial
    governor.  Delaware occupies the northeastern portion of the Delmarva Peninsula
    and some islands and territory within the Delaware River. It is the second smallest
    and sixth least populous state, but the sixth most densely populated. Delaware's
    largest city is Wilmington. The state is divided into three counties, the lowest
    number of any state. From north to south, they are New Castle County, Kent County,
    and Sussex County. While the southern two counties have historically been predominantly
    agricultural, New Castle County is more urbanized.  Before its coastline was explored
    by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of
    Native Americans, including the Lenape in the north and Nanticoke in the south.
    It was initially colonized by Dutch traders at Zwaanendael, near the present town
    of Lewes, in 1631. Delaware was one of the 13 colonies participating in the American
    Revolution. On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the
    Constitution of the United States, and has since been known as "The First State".
