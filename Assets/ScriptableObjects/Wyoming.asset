  info: "Wyoming is a state in the mountain region of the Western United States. The
    state is the 10th largest by area, the least populous, and the second most sparsely
    populated state in the country. Wyoming is bordered on the north by Montana, on
    the east by South Dakota and Nebraska, on the south by Colorado, on the southwest
    by Utah, and on the west by Idaho and Montana. The state population was estimated
    at 577,737 in 2018, which is less than 31 of the most populous U.S. cities including
    Denver in neighboring Colorado. Cheyenne is the state capital and the most populous
    city, with an estimated population of 63,624 in 2017.  The western two-thirds
    of the state is covered mostly by the mountain ranges and rangelands of the Rocky
    Mountains, while the eastern third of the state is high elevation prairie called
    the High Plains. Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the U.S. government,
    leading Wyoming to rank sixth by area and fifth by proportion of a state's land
    owned by the federal government. Federal lands include two national parks\u2014Grand
    Teton and Yellowstone\u2014two national recreation areas, two national monuments,
    several national forests, historic sites, fish hatcheries, and wildlife refuges.
    \ Original inhabitants of the region include the Crow, Arapaho, Lakota, and Shoshone.
    Southwestern Wyoming was claimed by the Spanish Empire and then Mexican territory
    until it was ceded to the United States in 1848 at the end of the Mexican\u2013American
    War. The region acquired the name Wyoming when a bill was introduced to the U.S.
    Congress in 1865 to provide a \"temporary government for the territory of Wyoming\".
    The name was used earlier for the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania, and is derived
    from the Munsee word xw\xE9:wam\u0259nk, meaning \"at the big river flat\".  The
    main drivers of Wyoming's economy are mineral extraction\u2014mostly coal, oil,
    natural gas, and trona\u2014and tourism. Agricultural commodities include livestock
    (beef), hay, sugar beets, grain (wheat and barley), and wool. The climate is semi-arid
    and continental, drier and windier than the rest of the U.S., with greater temperature
    extremes.  Wyoming has been a politically conservative state since the 1950s,
    with the Republican Party candidate winning every presidential election except
    that of 1964."
