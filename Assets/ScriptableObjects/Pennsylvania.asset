  info: "Pennsylvania, officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located
    in the Northeastern, Great Lakes, Appalachian, and Mid-Atlantic regions of the
    United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The Commonwealth
    is bordered by Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia
    to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario
    to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.  Pennsylvania
    is the 33rd-largest state by area, and the 5th-most populous state according to
    the most recent official U.S. Census count in 2010. It is the 9th-most densely
    populated of the 50 states. Pennsylvania's two most populous cities are Philadelphia
    (1,580,863), and Pittsburgh (302,407). The state capital and its 10th-largest
    city is Harrisburg. Pennsylvania has 140 miles (225 km) of waterfront along Lake
    Erie and the Delaware River.  The state is one of the 13 original founding states
    of the United States; it came into being in 1681 as a result of a royal land grant
    to William Penn, the son of the state's namesake. Part of Pennsylvania (along
    the Delaware River), together with the present State of Delaware, had earlier
    been organized as the Colony of New Sweden. It was the second state to ratify
    the United States Constitution, on December 12, 1787. Independence Hall, where
    the United States Declaration of Independence and United States Constitution were
    drafted, is located in the state's largest city of Philadelphia. During the American
    Civil War, the Battle of Gettysburg was fought in the south central region of
    the state. Valley Forge near Philadelphia was General Washington's headquarters
    during the bitter winter of 1777\u201378."
