  info: "Kansas is a U.S. state in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka
    and its largest city is Wichita, with its most populated county and largest employment
    center being Johnson County. Kansas is bordered by Nebraska on the north; Missouri
    on the east; Oklahoma on the south; and Colorado on the west. Kansas is named
    after the Kansas River, which in turn was named after the Kansa Native Americans
    who lived along its banks. The tribe's name (natively kk\u0105:ze) is often said
    to mean \"people of the (south) wind\" although this was probably not the term's
    original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous
    and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally
    lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state
    were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison.  Kansas was first settled by
    Americans in 1827 with the establishment of Fort Leavenworth. The pace of settlement
    accelerated in the 1850s, in the midst of political wars over the slavery debate.
    When it was officially opened to settlement by the U.S. government in 1854 with
    the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, abolitionist Free-Staters from New England and pro-slavery
    settlers from neighboring Missouri rushed to the territory to determine whether
    Kansas would become a free state or a slave state. Thus, the area was a hotbed
    of violence and chaos in its early days as these forces collided, and was known
    as Bleeding Kansas. The abolitionists prevailed, and on January 29, 1861, Kansas
    entered the Union as a free state, hence the unofficial nickname \"The Free State\".
    \ By 2015, Kansas was one of the most productive agricultural states, producing
    high yields of wheat, corn, sorghum, and soybeans. Kansas, which has an area of
    82,278 square miles (213,100 square kilometers) is the 15th-largest state by area
    and is the 34th most-populous of the 50 states with a population of 2,911,505.
    Residents of Kansas are called Kansans. Mount Sunflower is Kansas's highest point
    at 4,039 feet (1,231 meters)."
