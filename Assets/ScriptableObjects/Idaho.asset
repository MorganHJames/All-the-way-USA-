  info: "Idaho is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It
    borders the state of Montana to the east and northeast, Wyoming to the east, Nevada
    and Utah to the south, and Washington and Oregon to the west. To the north, it
    shares a small portion of the Canadian border with the province of British Columbia.
    With a population of approximately 1.7 million and an area of 83,569 square miles
    (216,440 km2), Idaho is the 14th largest, the 12th least populous and the 7th
    least densely populated of the 50 U.S. states. The state's capital and largest
    city is Boise.  Idaho prior to European settlement was inhabited by Native American
    peoples, some of whom still live in the area. In the early 19th century, Idaho
    was considered part of the Oregon Country, an area disputed between the U.S. and
    the United Kingdom. It officially became U.S. territory with the signing of the
    Oregon Treaty of 1846, but a separate Idaho Territory was not organized until
    1863, instead being included for periods in Oregon Territory and Washington Territory.
    Idaho was eventually admitted to the Union on July 3, 1890, becoming the 43rd
    state.  Forming part of the Pacific Northwest (and the associated Cascadia bioregion),
    Idaho is divided into several distinct geographic and climatic regions. The state's
    north, the relatively isolated Idaho Panhandle, is closely linked with Eastern
    Washington with which it shares the Pacific Time Zone\u2014the rest of the state
    uses the Mountain Time Zone. The state's south includes the Snake River Plain
    (which has most of the population and agricultural land). The state's south-east
    incorporates part of the Great Basin. Idaho is quite mountainous, and contains
    several stretches of the Rocky Mountains. The United States Forest Service holds
    about 38% of Idaho's land, the highest proportion of any state.  Industries significant
    for the state economy include manufacturing, agriculture, mining, forestry, and
    tourism. A number of science and technology firms are either headquartered in
    Idaho or have factories there, and the state also contains the Idaho National
    Laboratory, which is the country's largest Department of Energy facility. Idaho's
    agricultural sector supplies many products, but the state is best known for its
    potato crop, which comprises around one-third of the nationwide yield. The official
    state nickname is the \"Gem State\", which references Idaho's natural beauty."
