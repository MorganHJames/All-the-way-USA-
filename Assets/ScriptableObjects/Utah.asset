  info: 'Utah is a state in the western United States. It became the 45th state admitted
    to the U.S. on January 4, 1896. Utah is the 13th-largest by area, 30th-most-populous,
    and 11th-least-densely populated of the 50 United States. Utah has a population
    of more than 3 million according to the Census estimate for July 1, 2018. Urban
    development is mostly concentrated in two areas: the Wasatch Front in the north-central
    part of the state, which contains approximately 2.5 million people; and Washington
    County in Southern Utah, with over 160,000 residents. Utah is bordered by Colorado
    to the east, Wyoming to the northeast, Idaho to the north, Arizona to the south,
    and Nevada to the west. It also touches a corner of New Mexico in the southeast.  Approximately
    62% of Utahns are reported to be members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
    Saints (LDS Church), making Utah the only state with a majority population belonging
    to a single church. This greatly influences Utahn culture, politics, and daily
    life. The church''s world headquarters is located in Salt Lake City.  The state
    is a center of transportation, education, information technology and research,
    government services, and mining and a major tourist destination for outdoor recreation.
    In 2013, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that Utah had the second-fastest-growing
    population of any state. St. George was the fastest-growing metropolitan area
    in the United States from 2000 to 2005. Utah also has the 14th-highest median
    average income and the least income inequality of any U.S. state. A 2012 Gallup
    national survey found Utah overall to be the "best state to live in the future"
    based on 13 forward-looking measurements including various economic, lifestyle,
    and health-related outlook metrics.'
