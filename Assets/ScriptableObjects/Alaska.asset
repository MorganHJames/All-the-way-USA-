  info: "Alaska is a U.S. state in the northwest extremity of the United States West
    Coast, just across the Bering Strait from Asia. The Canadian province of British
    Columbia and territory of Yukon border the state to the east and southeast. Its
    most extreme western part is Attu Island, and it has a maritime border with Russia
    (Chukotka Autonomous Okrug) to the west across the Bering Strait. To the north
    are the Chukchi and Beaufort seas\u2014southern parts of the Arctic Ocean. The
    Pacific Ocean lies to the south and southwest. It is the largest U.S. state by
    area and the seventh largest subnational division in the world. In addition, it
    is the 3rd least populous and the most sparsely populated of the 50 United States;
    nevertheless, it is by far the most populous territory located mostly north of
    the 60th parallel in North America: its population\u2014estimated at 738,432 by
    the United States Census Bureau in 2015 \u2014 is more than quadruple the combined
    populations of Northern Canada and Greenland. Approximately half of Alaska's residents
    live within the Anchorage metropolitan area. Alaska's economy is dominated by
    the fishing, natural gas, and oil industries, resources which it has in abundance.
    United States armed forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the
    economy.  On March 30, 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian
    Empire for 7.2 million U.S. dollars, or approximately two cents per acre ($4.74/km2).
    The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized
    as a territory on May 11, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S.
    on January 3, 1959."
