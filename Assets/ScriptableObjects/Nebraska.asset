  info: "Nebraska is a state that lies in both the Great Plains and the Midwestern
    United States. It is bordered by South Dakota to the north; Iowa to the east and
    Missouri to the southeast, both across the Missouri River; Kansas to the south;
    Colorado to the southwest; and Wyoming to the west. It is the only triply landlocked
    U.S. state.  Nebraska's area is just over 77,220 square miles (200,000 km2) with
    a population of almost 1.9 million people. Its state capital is Lincoln, and its
    largest city is Omaha, which is on the Missouri River.  Indigenous peoples, including
    Omaha, Missouria, Ponca, Pawnee, Otoe, and various branches of the Lakota (Sioux)
    tribes, lived in the region for thousands of years before European exploration.
    The state is crossed by many historic trails, including that of the Lewis and
    Clark Expedition.  Nebraska was admitted as the 37th state of the United States
    in 1867. It is the only state in the United States whose legislature is unicameral
    and officially nonpartisan.  Nebraska is composed of two major land regions: the
    Dissected Till Plains and the Great Plains. The Dissected Till Plains region consist
    of gently rolling hills and contains the state's largest cities, Omaha and Lincoln.
    The Great Plains region, occupying most of western Nebraska, is characterized
    by treeless prairie, suitable for cattle-grazing.  Nebraska has two major climatic
    zones. The eastern half of the state has a humid continental climate (K\xF6ppen
    climate classification Dfa); a unique warmer subtype considered \"warm-temperate\"
    exists near the southern plains like in Kansas and Oklahoma which have a predominantly
    humid subtropical climate. The western half of the state has a primarily semi-arid
    climate (Koppen BSk). The state has wide variations between winter and summer
    temperatures, variations that decrease moving south in the state. Violent thunderstorms
    and tornadoes occur primarily during spring and summer and sometimes in autumn.
    Chinook wind tends to warm the state significantly in the winter and early spring."
